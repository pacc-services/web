Rather than allowing this hydrogen byproduct to go unused, K2 is investing in advanced systems to capture, purify, compress, and distribute it as low-carbon fuel. With Hargrove Engineers & Constructors leading EPC execution, the project is turning a byproduct into a new clean-energy commodity for California.",
